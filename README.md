# Chem-Learning-Challenge
Air pollution is a persistent problem of the world, which has been around for a while and will continue to exist in the future. It is a cause of a lot of problems and has extremely adverse effects. For curbing air pollution, its analysis is first necessary. For making predictions about the air quality, domain knowledge is essential, as are data analysis skills. This problem statement tests them all.

## Problem Statement
Participating teams are invited to propose and implement a multiclass classification technique for a given data set of air quality measurements. We expect a well-structured report detailing the approach used for classification and its implementation. Teams would be provided with the training data set to be used. Teams are expected to brainstorm, ideate, experiment, and code classification techniques to get the best results. The goal of this challenge is to create awareness about the applications of data analysis and machine learning in the chemical engineering domain, especially air quality analysis for air pollution control applications among the student community and provide them a platform to showcase their ideas and innovations.

## Files Description
1) Train.IPYNB 
The jupyter notebook where training takes place. You can alter the hyper parametrs to look for the best performing model and save the corresponding weights into weights file.
This notebook requires the CLC_train.csv, CLC_test.csv to be present in the same folder.

2) Test.py
Script which loads the model (from the weights file) and evaluates on CLC_test.csv (required to be present in the same folder) and stores the predictions in submission_trials.csv under the column "Our prediction".

3) weights
The file which stores the state_dict of our best performing model.

4) submission_csv.csv
The csv files which stores the predictions of our best performing model(from the weights file)

5) CLC_train.csv, CLC_test.csv are train and test data respectively.

6) Data_analysis.ipynb is the priminary data exploration and finding out relevant features and attributes.

7) Report.pdf Comprehensive description of our experiments and our findings along with the results.

## Experiments
Our approach to predict the pollution levels in the air is through a feed
forward neural network. We preferred deployment of a multi-layered
feedforward neural network over straight forward implementation of a
Machine Learning algorithm (like a random forest, SVM or decision tree)
due to increased performance bartered by the multiple layers over
greater model complexity. The accuracy over validation data from ML
algorithms seemed to saturate at ~70 - 75%. Whereas Neural Network
enable us to alter this scenario.A 4-layered network was observed to fare better on cross-validation set
than a single layered machine learning algorithm. Careful design of
parameters and hyper parameter tuning of each layer heightens the
accuracy obtained. We experimented with the number of neurons of 
each layer and activation functions and found the below depicted model
to perform the best for the given data.
